    This is my formal blog. This is a very recent project so don't expect there to be a lot...<br>
    I will share my homelab and other tech related things over here.
    It is made using <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/" target="_blank">Quartz v4</a>, a tool to easily use a Obsidian vault as a website. 
    Looks kinda boring but it works for now. I might try changing it in the future.
