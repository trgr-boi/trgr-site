    This is my formal blog. This is a very recent project so don't expect there
    to be a lot...<br />
    I will share my homelab and other tech related things over here. It is made
    using <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/" target="_blank">Quartz v4</a>, a
    tool to easily use a Obsidian vault as a website. Looks kinda boring but it
    works for now. I might try changing it in the future.
