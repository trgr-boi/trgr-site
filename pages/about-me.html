    Hi, <br /><br />
    My name is <b>**TRGR**</b>. This is my personal website where I can do
    wathever I want. I am just a guy with a bachelor in Graphic design, with a
    passion for music and some coding as well. <br /><br />

    Got my bachelor at
    <a
      href="https://www.luca-arts.be/nl/grafisch-ontwerp-campus-gent-sint-lucas-bachelor"
      >LUCA School of Arts Ghent.</a
    >
    <br />

    Now doing a bachelor Computer Science at
    <a
      href="https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/"
      >HoGent</a
    >. <br /><br />

    I am a human from <i>*Belgium*</i> who likes to make all kinds of stuff. I’m
    quite busy with school at the moment but I still manage to find some time to
    work on personal projects.<br />
    I do all sorts of projects. Like making all types of sound, from bleep
    bloops to bonk bonk. And projects that make pixels and computers talk, like
    the project you are looking at. <br />
    But I am more and more falling into the network/server side of IT, what lead
    me to homelabbing and wasting so much damn time this way :)
    <br /><br />

    This site will be a collection site of all my projects and places.<br>
    I’ve been working on and remaking this a lot but I think I finally
    managed to find a design and structure that I like! If you want to know more
    about it, go to the <i>*about.page.md*</i> section.<br /><br />
    For now, enjoy what is here! <br /><br />
